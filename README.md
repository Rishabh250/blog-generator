# AutoBlogGen: Advanced Blog Automation System

## Description
AutoBlogGen is a cutting-edge blog automation system designed to streamline the process of blog creation, management, and deployment. Built with TypeScript and Express, this backend application offers a robust solution for handling HTTP requests with efficiency and ease. The system is architected to ensure a clear separation of concerns, employing controllers, services, routes, models, and middleware for organized and maintainable code.
